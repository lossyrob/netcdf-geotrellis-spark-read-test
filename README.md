### NetCDF reading from GeoTrellis into Spark

To download the data, run `./getdata.sh`

To run, do `./run.sh`

You'll need gdal java bindings installed on the machine, with HDF5 and netCDF support. This can be a pain.
Try `sudo apt-get install libgdal-java=1.10.1` perhaps, or take a look at `https://github.com/geotrellis/gdal-scala`
